# Step 4: Present and Act

## RULES

- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`
- When `{ticket_args}` is set, append findings only to the resolved ticket plan. Never run `tickets.py mark` or edit sprint status for a ticket review.
- When `{ticket_args}` is empty and `{plan_file}` is a legacy story/spec, retain the legacy story and sprint-status behavior below.
- `decision-needed` findings must be resolved before handling `patch` findings.

## INSTRUCTIONS

### 1. Clean review shortcut

If zero findings remain after triage (all dismissed or none raised): state that and proceed to section 6 (Sprint Status Update).

### 2. Persist findings

When `{ticket_args}` is set, append one dated `## Code Review` block to `{plan_file}`. Include every triaged finding, its category, source location, disposition, and each deferred reason. Do not edit any ticket file, story file, or tracker state; the ticket remains at its current status.

Otherwise, if `{plan_file}` exists and contains a Tasks/Subtasks section, append a `### Review Findings` subsection. Write all findings in this order:

1. **`decision-needed`** findings (unchecked):
   `- [ ] [Review][Decision] <Title> — <Detail>`

2. **`patch`** findings (unchecked):
   `- [ ] [Review][Patch] <Title> [<file>:<line>]`

3. **`defer`** findings (checked off, marked deferred):
   `- [x] [Review][Defer] <Title> [<file>:<line>] — deferred, pre-existing`

For legacy reviews only (`{ticket_args}` empty), also append each `defer` finding to `{deferred_work_file}` under a heading `## Deferred from: code review ({date})`. If `{plan_file}` is set, include its basename in the heading. One bullet per finding with description.

### 3. Present summary

Announce what was written:

> **Code review complete.** <D> `decision-needed`, <P> `patch`, <W> `defer`, <R> dismissed as noise.

If `{ticket_args}` is set, add: `Findings written to the Code Review section in {plan_file}; ticket status was not changed.`
Otherwise, if `{plan_file}` is set, add: `Findings written to the review findings section in {plan_file}.`
Otherwise add: `Findings are listed above. No story file was provided, so nothing was persisted.`

### 4. Resolve decision-needed findings

If `decision_needed` findings exist, present each one with its detail and the options available. The user must decide — the correct fix is ambiguous without their input. Walk through each finding (or batch related ones) and get the user's call. Once resolved, each becomes a `patch`, `defer`, or is dismissed.

If the user chooses to defer, ask: Quick one-line reason for deferring this item? (helps future reviews): — then append that reason to both the story file bullet and the `{deferred_work_file}` entry.

**HALT** — I am waiting for your numbered choice. Reply with only the number. Do not proceed until you select an option.

### 5. Handle `patch` findings

If `patch` findings exist (including any resolved from step 4), HALT. Ask the user:

If `{plan_file}` is set, present all three options:

> **How would you like to handle the `<P>` `patch` findings?**
> 1. **Apply every patch** — fix all of them now, no per-finding confirmation. Defer and decision-needed items are not touched.
> 2. **Leave as action items** — they are already in the story file
> 3. **Walk through each patch** — show details for each before deciding

If `{plan_file}` is **not** set, present only options 1 and 2 (omit "Leave as action items" — findings were not written to a file):

> **How would you like to handle the `<P>` `patch` findings?**
> 1. **Apply every patch** — fix all of them now, no per-finding confirmation. Defer and decision-needed items are not touched.
> 2. **Walk through each patch** — show details for each before deciding

**HALT** — I am waiting for your numbered choice. Reply with only the number. Do not proceed until you select an option.

- **Apply every patch**: Apply every patch finding without per-finding confirmation. Do not modify defer or decision-needed items. After all patches are applied, present a summary of changes made. If `{plan_file}` is set, check off the patch items in the story file (leave defer items as-is).
- **Leave as action items** (only when `{plan_file}` is set): Done — findings are already written to the story.
- **Walk through each patch**: Present each finding with full detail, diff context, and suggested fix. After walkthrough, re-offer the applicable options above.

  **HALT** — I am waiting for your numbered choice. Do not proceed until you select an option.

**✅ Code review actions complete**

- Decision-needed resolved: <D>
- Patches handled: <P>
- Deferred: <W>
- Dismissed: <R>

### 6. Update legacy story status and sprint tracking

Skip this entire section when `{ticket_args}` is set or `{plan_file}` is not set. A ticket review never mutates ticket status or legacy sprint status.

#### Determine new legacy status based on review outcome

- If all `decision-needed` and `patch` findings were resolved (fixed or dismissed) AND no unresolved `high`/`medium` findings remain: set `{new_status}` = `done`. Update the story file Status section to `done`.
- If `patch` findings were left as action items, or unresolved issues remain: set `{new_status}` = `in-progress`. Update the story file Status section to `in-progress`.

Save the story file.

#### Sync sprint-status.yaml

If `{story_key}` is not set, skip this subsection and note that sprint status was not synced because no story key was available.

If `{sprint_status}` file exists:

1. Load the FULL `{sprint_status}` file.
2. Find the `development_status` entry matching `{story_key}`.
3. If found: update `development_status[{story_key}]` to `{new_status}`. Update `last_updated` to current date. Save the file, preserving ALL comments and structure including STATUS DEFINITIONS.
4. If `{story_key}` not found in sprint status: warn the user that the story file was updated but sprint-status sync failed.

If `{sprint_status}` file does not exist, note that story status was updated in the story file only.

#### Completion summary

> **Review Complete!**
>
> **Story Status:** `{new_status}`
> **Issues Fixed:** <fixed_count>
> **Action Items Created:** <action_count>
> **Deferred:** <W>
> **Dismissed:** <R>

### 7. Next steps

Present the user with follow-up options:

> **What would you like to do next?**
> 1. **Start the next story** — run `dev-story` to pick up the next `ready-for-dev` story
> 2. **Re-run code review** — address findings and review again
> 3. **Done** — end the workflow

**HALT** — I am waiting for your choice. Do not proceed until the user selects an option.
